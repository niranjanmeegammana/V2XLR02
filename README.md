Next-Generation V2X Communication and Authentication Security: A Multi-Dimensional Review of Threats and Defenses
abstract}
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication constitutes a foundational component of autonomous and connected transportation systems, enabling real-time coordination among vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud-edge services. However, its wireless, decentralised, and latency-critical architecture introduces systemic cybersecurity vulnerabilities that extend beyond conventional network threats. Although existing surveys provide broad taxonomies of attacks and countermeasures, they rarely examine why many proposed defences fail to achieve large-scale deployment, particularly under stringent latency constraints, heterogeneous communication standards, and cross-layer trust fragmentation.

This study addresses that gap through a systematic review of 52 peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2025, focusing on the Network and Communication and Authentication and Access Control domains that most directly influence operational trust and safety in V2X environments. We introduce a formally defined Hybrid Multi-Dimensional Security Framework (HMSF) that integrates threat typology, adversarial capability modelling, and defence evaluation across technical layers under the extended CIAAAP objectives—Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Accountability, and Privacy. Unlike prior surveys that adopt flat taxonomies or isolated performance comparisons, HMSF enables cross-layer reasoning by explicitly correlating attack vectors, mitigation mechanisms, deployment feasibility, and scalability constraints.

The review analyses dominant threat classes including denial-of-service, jamming, man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, Sybil attacks, and misbehaviour scenarios, while critically evaluating AI-driven intrusion detection, blockchain-based trust architectures, lightweight cryptographic protocols, and post-quantum resilience strategies. Our synthesis reveals persistent structural gaps in certificate revocation scalability, latency-aware authentication, interoperability across DSRC, C-V2X, and 5G architectures, and the transition from simulation-based validation to field-grade resilience. By framing V2X security as a design-for-resilience challenge in cyber-physical systems engineering, this study provides a deployment-oriented analytical foundation and a strategic roadmap toward scalable, interoperable, and quantum-ready V2X security architectures.
